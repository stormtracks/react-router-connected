I ported over
[this basic demo](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router/tree/master/examples/basic)

to create-react-app...

[Example code ](https://github.com/stormasm/react-router-v4-demo/blob/7cdaaaab29e63b67247c7b5bd8be226e76c083e5/Demo-03-Nested-routing-with-params/src/Products.jsx#L36)

of how to build up your
[Links](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link)

based upon an array of first parameters in your URL.

So in the case of the chapter/section example.

```
http://localhost:3000/ch1/sec3
```

What you want to be able to do is use the picker or dropdown
to change **ch1** to {ch2, ch3}.

Enabling future functionality of changing the github repo but
keeping the view the same in the Github Explorer.
